# PokéIndex

This simple app shows the first 151 Pokémon, their genus, types, and base stats. This assignment taught the building blocks of Javscript.

Users can view all the pokemon on the page and click on them for more information within a modal. Animations were added for a smoother transition, and users can use the search bar to look up a specific pokemon.

No bootstrap or jquery was used for this. This app was made purely from Javascript. Bootstrap and jquery was used temporarily but removed when more in-depth customization began. It also uses pokeapi (https://pokeapi.co/) for all the data it displays.
